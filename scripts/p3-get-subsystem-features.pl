=head1 Get All the Features in One or More Subsystems

    p3-get-subsystem-features.pl [options]

This script takes as input a file of subsystem IDs (names) and lists the features in each one.  As with all database
scripts, the fields retrieved are appended to the input record.  In this case, however, the number of results returned
for each input record is expected to be very large.

Note that the returned object is a subsystem-item record.  It contains data about the feature's relationship to the
subsystem, not the feature itself.  To get feature data, pipe this command into L<p3-get-feature-data.pl>.

=head2 Parameters

There are no positional parameters.

The standard input can be overridden using the options in L<P3Utils/ih_options>.

Additional command-line options are those given in L<P3Utils/data_options> and L<P3Utils/col_options> plus the following.

=over 4

=item fields

List the available field names.

=item names

If specified, then the input is presumed to contain subsystem names (with spaces) instead of subsystem IDs (with
underscores).  Note that some subsystem names have invisible spaces at the end, and these MUST be included in the
input.
