=head1 Find Subsystems for a Genome

This object is used to perform a basic role-based projection of subsystems onto genomes. The
core method takes as input a pair of hashes and a table of feature IDs to function IDs. The
basic algorithm is then as follows:

=over 4

=item 1

Use the functions to compute the subsystems for each feature.

=item 2

For each subsystem found, match the set of roles therein to known variants. If all of the roles in a
variant are present, then it is a I<candidate variant> for the subsystem.

=item 3

Choose the candidate variant with the most roles and output the features in the subsystem based on
that variant.

=back

The object contains the following fields.

=over 4

=item roleMap

Reference to a hash mapping each role checksum to a list of subsystem names.

=item variantMap

Reference to a hash mapping each subsystem name to a list of variant tuples. Each variant tuple consists of
a variant code followed by a list of role checksums.

=item stats

A statistics object containing statistics for this process.

=back

=head2 Special Methods

    my $projector = SubsystemProjector->new($roleFile, $variantFile);

Create a projector object. The projector object contains a map of roles to subsystems and a map of
subsystems to variants. Each variant is a list of roles. Each role is stored in the form of the checksum
computed by L<RoleParse>.

=over 4

=item roleFile

Name of a tab-delimited file containing [role checksum, subsystem name] pairs.

=item variantFile

Name of a tab-delimited file containing in each record (0) a subsystem name, (1) a variant code, and
(2) a space-delimited list of role checksums.

=back
